      <p>Inclusive Development International works with communities and local civil society groups to hold governments, 
        development finance institutions, and corporate actors accountable for human rights violations and environmental 
        damage caused by irresponsible development and business conduct. We support affected communities to understand their 
        rights and potential advocacy strategies; identify responsible actors; document harms and violations of human rights,
         laws and policies; and seek recourse through evidence-based advocacy and by accessing a range of transnational judicial 
         and non-judicial remedies.</p>
